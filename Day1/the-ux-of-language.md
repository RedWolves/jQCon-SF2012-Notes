# The UX of Language

## Alex Sexton

### Abstract
There are 1 thing(s) that you have probably noticed about l10n and I18n in your JavaScript App(s). The sentences, even in english, are as ridiculous as the first one in this paragraph. Sure, you may be used to it, but it's a crappy user experience. There's lots you can do to make your data driven sentences valid, even expressive, in your language, and then expand that to any language. This talk will round up a set of tools and techniques to help prepare you to write apps that don't sound like Borat.
