# What's jQuery Doing on Standards?

## Yehuda Katz

### Abstract
A few months ago, the jQuery Foundation announced its participation in the W3C and ECMA standards bodies. Why did we do this, and how are we doing?

In this talk, Yehuda will give a rough overview of the standardization process, some examples of ways that web developers have helped the process, and talk about how the jQuery project is making a difference.
