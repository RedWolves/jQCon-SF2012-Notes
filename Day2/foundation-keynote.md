# jQuery Foundation Keynote

## Richard D. Worth ( richard@jquery.com )
Executive Director - jQuery Foundation

### Abstract
An overview of the changes to the organization of the jQuery Project.

## Notes

* jQuery is now on 58% of the top 10,000 sites ( see http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery )
	* 25 of the top 50 JavaScript technologies are based on jQuery, including 5 in the top 10
* The first 2.5 years (including the first three conferences) the project was run out of John Resig's PayPal account
* Joined the [Software Freedom Conservancy](http://sfconservancy.org/) in Sept '09
	* This allowed the jQuery Project to grow with a singular focus on the code and the community, with legal and financial concerns handled entirely by the SFC
	* The jQuery Project grew to be larger (by some relevant measures) than all the other member projects of the SFC ( see http://sfconservancy.org/members/current/ )
	* It is the design and goal of the SFC to assist member projects in their growth to eventually stand on their own
* jQuery created its own 501(c)6 organization in Feb 2012
	* jQuery Foundation
	* Non-profit Trade Association or Business League
	* NFL (National Football League) is also a 501(c)6 ( see http://sportsfans.org/2012/03/why-is-the-national-football-league-given-tax-exempt-status/ )
	* A trade association or business league exists to
		* connect businesses and individuals that share a common business interest
		* improve business conditions
